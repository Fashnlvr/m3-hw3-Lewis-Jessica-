##Stumbling Blocks
I had no issues coding the website for this assignment. However, I did run into trouble when attempting to push my changes from VS Code to GitHub. For some reason, no changes were made within GitHub when using the terminal commands in VS Code or through my Mac's terminal. I was able to resolve the issues after trial and error by using the Source Control Menu, selecting Git Push, and entering a message before hitting the Commit & Push button.
